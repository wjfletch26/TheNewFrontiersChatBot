# The "New" Frontiers Chat Bot Widget:  "Whippy"
#### "Whippy" Chat Widget is a helpful assistant or Ranch Hand, at your service. To serve users and ultimately, the Livestock... get to where they need to be.  

The vision:  What is an assistant?  The first one many remember is [Clippy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kcQzCzSDvc) (if you used Microsoft Word).  A friendly assistant.  That's how Whippy came to be here, to help the new Frontiers and their Livestock.  

Sure, he is a paperclip... but he is so much more than that.  
He ropes, rides, takes care of the Livestock, and he makes sure they get to where they need to go.
